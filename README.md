# Cube-Java-Program



<h2>Description</h2>

- <b>The class "cubeDef.java" is a Java assignment where I had to write a class definition for a cube that allows the user to set and retrieve its properties. The properties defined are length, color, and whether the cube will be filled or hollow. The user can also calculate the surface area, volume, and resize the cube. The class "cube.java" uses the cubedef class to ask the user to input what they want for their cube and if they would like to change it. The output is then displayed to the user listing the details about their cube </b>
